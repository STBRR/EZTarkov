Locales files need to be placed into the correct folder so they are loaded to the correct language setting. The following is an example where all values on the right are the values that need to be in the elected language. (e.g. EN = English) 
{
    "quest": {
        "VCQ_1": {
            "conditions": {
                "VCQ_1_AFF_0": "Kill 10 scavs on woods"
            },
            "name": "No Man",
            "description": "Kill those pesky scavs, arrgh.",
            "note": "",
            "failMessageText": "",
            "successMessageText": "Well done!!",
            "location": "5714dbc024597771384a510d"
        }
    }
}
