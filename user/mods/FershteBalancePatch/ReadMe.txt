This mod has an expirimental compatability feature - 
if you set "compatability" to true in the config (defaults to false), all items that should be compatible IRL will now have that functionality. 
There is a chance for clipping, so if you see clipping just don't use that. Tarkov has no way to set up an if a & b (or even more complex) conflict system.

Currently the "compatability" setting only adjusts .308 caliber muzzle devices & barrels, and the Hybrid 46 & Omega45 silencers. - try an MCX with the Omega45, it's very cool looking :)



A wise man once said "If an M4 in a game is a bad weapon, then the GAME is wrong."

This mod adjusts basically every single category of part in an attempt to bring variety and flavor to weapon modding, improving almost every "non meta" part in the game, bringing everything closer together. 
The Meta builds are EXACTLY THE SAME as they used to be, but now there are more parts that are equal to those builds, and parts that were considered mediocre or bad are now more realistically good.
